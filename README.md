# ToDoList-8

# Description:
- It’s a list of tasks you need to complete, or things that you want to do.
- One of the most important reasons you should use a todo list is that it will   help you stay organised. When you write all your tasks in a list, they seem more manageable. When you’ve got a clear outline of the tasks you’ve got to do and those you’ve completed, it helps you stay focused. While freeing up space in your mind for other more creative tasks.
